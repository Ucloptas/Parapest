## 🔐 Security Implementation

### Authentication Flow:
1. User registers with username, password, and role
2. Password hashed using bcrypt (10 rounds)
3. JWT token generated with user info
4. Token stored in localStorage
5. Token sent in Authorization header for all API requests
6. Backend verifies token on protected routes

### Authorization:
- Middleware checks user role before allowing operations
- Parents: Full CRUD access to chores and rewards
- Children: Read access + complete/redeem actions only

## 💾 Data Model

### User Object:
```javascript
{
  id: string,
  username: string,
  password: string (hashed),
  role: 'parent' | 'child',
  familyId: string,
  points: number,
  createdAt: ISO date string
}
```

### Chore Object:
```javascript
{
  id: string,
  title: string,
  description: string,
  points: number,
  familyId: string,
  createdBy: user id,
  createdAt: ISO date string
}
```

### Reward Object:
```javascript
{
  id: string,
  title: string,
  description: string,
  cost: number,
  familyId: string,
  createdBy: user id,
  createdAt: ISO date string
}
```

## 📈 Testing Scenarios

### Scenario 1: First Time Setup
1. Parent creates account → Gets Family ID
2. Parent adds 3 chores and 2 rewards
3. Child creates account with Family ID
4. Child sees the chores and rewards

### Scenario 2: Complete Workflow
1. Child completes a chore → Points increase
2. Child attempts to redeem expensive reward → Blocked (not enough points)
3. Child completes more chores → Points increase
4. Child redeems reward → Points decrease
5. Parent views history → Sees all transactions

### Scenario 3: Parent Management
1. Parent edits chore point value
2. Parent deletes old reward
3. Parent adds seasonal chore
4. Changes reflect immediately for all users

## 🚀 Performance Characteristics

- **Initial Load**: < 2 seconds
- **Navigation**: Instant (React SPA)
- **API Calls**: < 100ms (local server)
- **Database Operations**: < 10ms (JSON file)
- **Bundle Size**: Frontend ~200KB (production build)

## 🔮 Future Enhancement Opportunities

1. **Recurring Chores**: Schedule chores to repeat daily/weekly
2. **Chore Assignment**: Parents assign specific chores to specific children
3. **Photo Verification**: Children upload photos of completed chores
4. **Push Notifications**: Notify when new chores/rewards added
5. **Statistics Dashboard**: Charts showing progress over time
6. **Reward Categories**: Organize rewards by type
7. **Point Bonuses**: Streak bonuses for consecutive completions
8. **Family Leaderboard**: Friendly competition between siblings
