##  Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   cd Prapest
   ```

2. **Install all dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm run install-all
   ```
   This will install dependencies for the root, backend, and frontend.

3. **Set up environment variables**
   
   Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory (copy from `.env.example`):
   ```bash
   cd backend
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
   
   Edit the `.env` file and set your JWT secret:
   ```
   PORT=5000
   JWT_SECRET=your-secret-key-change-this-in-production
   NODE_ENV=development
   ```

### Running the Application

**Development Mode (Recommended)**

Run both frontend and backend simultaneously:
```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start:
- Backend server on `http://localhost:5000`
- Frontend development server on `http://localhost:3000`

**Or run separately:**

Terminal 1 - Backend:
```bash
npm run server
```

Terminal 2 - Frontend:
```bash
npm run client
```

### First Time Setup

1. **Open your browser** and go to `http://localhost:3000`

2. **Create a Parent Account**
   - Click "Register here"
   - Choose "Parent" as your role
   - A Family ID will be generated for you
   - **Save this Family ID** - you'll need it for child accounts

3. **Create a Child Account**
   - Logout and click "Register here" again
   - Choose "Child" as your role
   - Enter the Family ID from step 2
   - Now both accounts are in the same family!

4. **Start Using the App**
   - Login as parent to add chores and rewards
   - Login as child to complete chores and redeem rewards

##  Security Notes

- The `.env` file contains sensitive information and should never be committed to version control
- Change the `JWT_SECRET` in production
- The `database.json` file stores all data - back it up regularly
- In production, consider using a proper database (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, etc.)

##  Features in Detail

### Points System
- Children earn points by completing chores
- Points are tracked in real-time
- Points can be redeemed for rewards
- All transactions are logged in the history

### Family System
- Each family has a unique Family ID
- Multiple children can join a family using the Family ID
- All family members share the same pool of chores and rewards

### User Roles
- **Parent**: Can create, edit, and delete chores and rewards
- **Child**: Can complete chores and redeem rewards (but cannot modify them)

##  Troubleshooting

**Problem: Port already in use**
- Solution: Change the port in `backend/.env` (backend) or `frontend/vite.config.js` (frontend)

**Problem: Cannot connect to backend**
- Solution: Make sure the backend server is running on port 5000
- Check the proxy configuration in `frontend/vite.config.js`

**Problem: Login not working**
- Solution: Make sure you've created an account first via the Register page
- Check that the backend server is running

**Problem: Data lost after restart**
- Solution: The `database.json` file stores all data. Make sure it's not being deleted
- Check file permissions

##  Future Enhancements

Ideas for future development:
- [ ] Add profile pictures for users
- [ ] Implement chore assignments (parent assigns specific chores to specific children)
- [ ] Add recurring chores (daily, weekly, etc.)
- [ ] Notification system
- [ ] Mobile app version
- [ ] Integration with the 2D platformer game
- [ ] Statistics and charts for tracking progress
- [ ] Photo verification for completed chores
- [ ] Custom themes and avatars
